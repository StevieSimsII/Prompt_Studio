   - IT department members
   - Permissions: Contribute

3. **AI Prompt Studio - Reviewers**
   - IT managers and senior staff
   - Permissions: Full Control (on AI Prompts list only)

4. **AI Prompt Studio - Administrators**
   - App owners and IT administrators
   - Permissions: Site Collection Administrator

### Step 2: Configure List Permissions

#### AI Prompts List Permissions
```
- Visitors: No access
- Members: Read (approved items only)

- Reviewers: Full Control
- Administrators: Full Control
```

```

### Step 3: Configure Power Apps Permissions

2. Set up environment security roles
3. Configure data source permissions

### Step 4: Configure Power Automate Permissions

2. Configure connection permissions
3. Set up approval action permissions

## Row-Level Security

### For Browse Functionality
Users can only see approved prompts:
```
Filter: Status = "Approved"
```

### For My Submissions
Users can only see their own submissions:
```
Filter: SubmittedBy = CurrentUser
```

### For Approval Dashboard
Reviewers can see pending and under review prompts:
```
Filter: Status = "Pending" OR Status = "Under Review"
```

## Audit and Compliance

### Audit Log Requirements
All actions must be logged including:
- Prompt submissions
- Approval/rejection decisions
- View/copy actions
- Administrative changes

### Data Retention
- Active prompts: Indefinite
- Rejected prompts: 1 year
- Audit logs: 7 years
- User activity: 2 years

### Compliance Considerations
- GDPR: User data handling procedures
- SOX: Audit trail requirements
- Corporate policies: Data classification

## Security Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual access patterns
- Bulk data exports
- Administrative actions
- Permission changes

### Alerts and Notifications
Configure alerts for:
- Multiple failed logins
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Unusual data access patterns
- System configuration changes

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Use strong passwords
- Log out when finished
- Report suspicious activity

### For Administrators
- Regular permission reviews
- Monitor audit logs
- Keep system updated
- Backup configurations
- Test security measures

### For Developers
- Validate all inputs
